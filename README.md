# Infrastructure Security Controls & Risk Mapping

This repository provides a structured, controls-first approach to
infrastructure and cloud security. It bridges security frameworks with
practical infrastructure security reviews, governance, and risk-based

The project is intended for demonstration, learning, and professional
portfolio use.
